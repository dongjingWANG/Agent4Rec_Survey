# About This Survey

## 📖 Overview

This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research on LLM-powered agents in recommendation systems from 2023 to 2025. We examine the field through four key dimensions:

### WHERE - Integration Strategies

We analyze three integration strategies for LLM agents and recommender systems:

1. **Agent as Rec**: The agent serves as the primary recommendation entity
2. **Agent for Rec**: The agent interacts with the system to enhance performance
3. **Agent in Rec**: The agent is embedded in specific process stages

### WHAT - System Architecture

We categorize systems based on the number of agents:

1. **Single-Agent Systems**: Systems with one autonomous agent
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Systems with multiple collaborating agents

### WHY - Application Scenarios

We investigate the underlying rationale for agent design:

1. **General Recommendations**: Enhancement of general recommendation tasks
2. **Domain-Specific Recommendations**: Vertical and domain-specific scenarios
3. **Interactive Recommendations**: Facilitation and improvement of interactive recommendations
4. **System Evaluation**: Assessment of recommender system performance

### HOW - Core Components

We highlight optimization approaches targeting the agents' core components:

1. **Profile Module**: User and item profiling
2. **Memory Module**: Short-term and long-term memory management
3. **Planning Module**: Task decomposition and planning strategies
4. **Action Module**: Tool usage and action execution

## 🎯 Survey Methodology
