## 📖 Abstract

In our survey, we offers a comprehensive review of recent research on LLM-powered agents in recommendation systems from the past three years, examining four key dimensions: where agents are applied, what agents are used, why agents are used, and how agents are designed.

For the **"WHERE"** question, we explore integration strategies for LLM-powered agents and recommendation systems, categorized as Agent as Rec (primary entity), Agent for Rec (interacting to enhance performance), and Agent in Rec (embedded in specific process stages). 

For the **"WHAT"** question, we categorize the systems according to the quantity of agents they include, distinguishing between single-agent and multi-agent setups. 

For the **"WHY"** question, we categorize systems according to the specific issues they tackle within improving general recommendations, domain-specific recommendations, interactive recommendations, and system evaluation. 

For the **"HOW"** question, we highlights optimization approaches targeting the agents' core components—Profile, Memory, Planning, and Action Modules—to boost overall system performance.
