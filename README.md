# Agent4Rec_Survey
A collection of resources and papers of **LLM-Based Agents for Recommender Systems** (Agent4Rec).
## 1. Papers
In our survey,  we offers a comprehensive review of recent research on LLM-based agents in recommendation systems from the past three years, examining four key dimensions: where
agents are applied, what agents are used, why agents are used, and how agents are designed.

The comparison between this work and existing surveys.
| **Paper** | **Where** | **What** |**Why** | **How** |**Pipeline** |**Highlights** |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------- |:------- |:------- |:------- |
| Recommender Systems Meet Large Language Model Agents: A Survey |  |✅|  |✅| (1) Agents for RS (2) RS for Agents (3) Trustworthy Agents and RS | analyzes how the LLM agent module supports recommendation systems and how recommendation systems,in turn, optimize the operation of these agents. |
| A Survey on LLM-powered Agents for Recommender Systems |  |✅|  |✅| (1) Recommender-oriented approaches (2) Interaction-oriented approaches (3) Simulation-oriented approaches | identifies three key paradigms in current research and explores their architectural components and evaluation frameworks.|
| A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval |  |✅|  |✅| (1) User Interaction (2) Item Representation (3) System Integration (4) Environment Simulation | emphasizes how LLM-based agents improve recommender systems by enabling deep semantic understanding, dynamic task decomposition, and interactive user engagement |
| **Ours** |✅|✅|✅|✅| (1) Where agents are applied (2) What agents are used (3) Why agents are used (4) How agents are designed | proposes four key questions—"Where," "What," "Why," and "How" to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing academic research. |

We classify papers according to where LLM Agents will be adapted in the pipeline of RS, which is summarized in the figure below.
