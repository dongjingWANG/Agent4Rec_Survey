Recommender Systems Meet Large Language Model Agents: A Survey,❌,✅,❌,✅,(1) Agents for RS (2) RS for Agents (3) Trustworthy Agents and RS,"analyzes how the LLM agent module supports recommendation systems and how recommendation systems,in turn, optimize the operation of these agents."
A Survey on LLM-powered Agents for Recommender Systems,❌,✅,❌,✅,(1) Recommender-oriented approaches (2) Interaction-oriented approaches (3) Simulation-oriented approaches,identifies three key paradigms in current research and explores their architectural components and evaluation frameworks.
A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval,❌,✅,❌,✅,(1) User Interaction (2) Item Representation (3) System Integration (4) Environment Simulation,"emphasizes how LLM-powered agents improve recommender systems by enabling deep semantic understanding, dynamic task decomposition, and interactive user engagement"
**Ours**,✅,✅,✅,✅,(1) Where agents are applied (2) What agents are used (3) Why agents are used (4) How agents are designed,"proposes four key questions��""Where,"" ""What,"" ""Why,"" and ""How"" to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing academic research."
